Hey, I am Ahmad Kabakibi. I am a senior software engineer, 30 years old and specialized in Full-stack web and mobile development. I have over 9 years experience with testing, prototyping, developer tooling, CI/CD, version control and awesome tech skills.<br>

My latest experiences include React and Typescript and its ecosystem (testing library, saga, redux, storybook, cypress, jest) and microservices architecture, hybrid mobile development, clean code, and design patterns.<br>

I love working in teams and gaining and sharing knowledge, which I believe are fundamental for one's professional development.<br>

I've been working in T-shaped engineering and part of a product team using Agile/Scrum methodology.

I love to make stuff happen!
